      <description>Challenge Obituary 395&amp;#43;398 points Hey, shoot me over your latest version of the code. I have a simple nc session up, just pass it over when you&amp;rsquo;re ready.
You&amp;rsquo;re using vim, right? You should use it; it&amp;rsquo;ll change your life. I basically depend on it for everything these days!
   Obituary 1 We are given an OpenVPN configuration file. This will allow us to connect to the VPN and have access to 172.</description>

      <title>infernoCTF: Weakened Keys</title>

      <description>Challenge Weakened Keys 400 points Local politicians and their anti crypto opinions have forced us to dumb down our AES encryption. It&amp;rsquo;s OK because we think we can still use these weakened keys and still encrypt our message securely by encrypting it twice. Have a look at our code and see what you think.
sample_encrypted_base64 = &#39;0mu0T97looX5/Oorw8ASGxfqMqrNoFajZupXrjtIAj7ECJdQXZzEmbEwdRV2J2MI&#39;
sample_plaintext = &#39;Double AES encryption for twice the strength.Win&#39;
flag_encrypted_base64 = &#39;lIZMVkA+pbiOxh3nNdV2bWz3gXovIy4fG7yCHa5FT44=&#39;
Hint: our keys only include printable ASCII characters</description>

      <description>Challenge Jacques! Au secours! 400 points One of our VIP clients, who wishes to remain anonymous, has apparently been hacked and all their important documents are now corrupted.
Can you help us recover the files? We found a strange piece of software that might have caused all of this.
File: chall_files.zip
  The challenge gives us a zip file with:
 a &amp;lsquo;vacation pictures&amp;rsquo; folder containing  4 encrypted images  DCIM-0533.</description>
